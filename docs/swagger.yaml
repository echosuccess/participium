      summary: Get all approved reports for map visualization
      description: |
        Retrieve all approved reports for display on an interactive map. This endpoint returns only reports 
        that have been approved by public relations officers and are in one of the following statuses:
        - ASSIGNED (approved and assigned to technical staff)
        - IN_PROGRESS (being worked on)
        - RESOLVED (completed)
        
        Reports with status PENDING_APPROVAL or REJECTED are NOT included in the response.
        
        This endpoint is designed for citizen-facing map views where users can see all active and resolved 
        issues in their area. The response includes reporter information (name or "anonymous" flag), location 
        coordinates, and other details needed for map markers and popups.
        
        Optionally filter by a bounding box using the `bbox` query parameter in the format 
        `minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat` (decimal degrees, WGS84). This is useful for map views where the 
        frontend requests only reports within the currently visible map area.
        
        The `category` query parameter is also optional and can be combined with `bbox` to request
        reports of a given category inside the visible map area (e.g. `?bbox=7.66,45.06,7.70,45.08&category=PUBLIC_LIGHTING`).
